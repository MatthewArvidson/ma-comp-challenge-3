# ma-comp-challenge-3

This was a very difficult project for me but I belive that I was able to maintian the essence of the Static Comp 3. It was very difficult to make the page responsive while babysitting all of the different elements, however, it was a lot of fun learning the higher level CSS tricks needed to pull this project off.

This is what the comp is supposed to look like:

This is a screen shot of how mine looked when it was finished.
